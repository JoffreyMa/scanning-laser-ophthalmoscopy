# scanning-laser-ophthalmoscopy (SLO)
Computer vision project about image segmentation

# Code
All the code is in the slo directory.\
It mainly contains trials of image processing technics.\
Some .py are more detailed processes to get a segmentation such as background_removal_[].py and sato.py.
Comparison of the processes is made with main.py, which calls evaluate.py and process.py.
